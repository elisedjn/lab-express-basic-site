          <h3>Destiny's Child</h3>
          <p>
            Teaming up with her cousin Kelly Rowland and two classmates, Knowles
            formed an all-female singing group. Her father, Matthew Knowles,
            served as the band's manager. The group went through some name and
            line-up changes before landing a record deal in 1997 with Columbia
            Records. Destiny's Child soon became one of the most popular R&B
            acts, with the release of their first, self-titled album. Gaining
            momentum, the group scored its first No. 1 single on the pop charts
            with "Bills, Bills, Bills," off their second album. The recording
            also featured another smash hit, "Say My Name." While enjoying her
            group's success, Knowles began exploring other projects. She made
            her acting debut in 2001 with a starring role in Carmen: A Hip
            Hopera. She then co-starred with Mike Myers in the Austin Powers spy
            parody Goldmember the following year.

          <h3>Solo Career</h3>
          <p>
            On the musical front, Knowles took center stage as a solo artist,
            releasing her first album, Dangerously in Love, in 2003. The
            recording became a huge success for her both commercially and
            critically. It sold millions of copies and won five Grammy Awards.
            On the album, Knowles worked with a number of different artists,
            including Missy Elliott, Sean Paul and Jay-Z. She was rumored to be
            dating Jay-Z around this time, but the couple did not publicly
            acknowledge their relationship. Destiny's Child released their last
            studio album, Destiny Fulfilled, in 2004, and officially broke up
            the following year. On her own, Knowles continued to enjoy great
            success. Her second studio album, 2006's B'Day featured such hits as
            "Irreplaceable" and "Deja Vu." On the big screen, she starred
            opposite Jennifer Hudson, Jaime Foxx and Eddie Murphy in Dreamgirls.
            The film was adapted from the hit Broadway musical of the same name.
